- Easy to use

## Usage
To use this plugin what you need is basically an anvil and an item which you'd like to rename or add custom model data

Example: 
- Compass exploit [CM:22] = is your prompt in anvil which will be automatically converted to:
- Compass exploit = and NBT tag of custom mode data 22 is already added

This also works with color and if you don't want to add any custom model data then just don't do it

Example:
- Compass &6exploit = which converts to:
- Compass exploit = with colored text
